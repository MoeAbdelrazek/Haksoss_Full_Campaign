<h1>Comprehensive Campaign Analysis & A/B Testing — Data Foundation</h1>
<p><strong>Author (Freelancer):</strong> Performance & Analytics Lead<br>
<strong>Client:</strong> Haksoss Café — Alexandria<br>
<strong>Scope:</strong> full campaign performance, channel analysis, A/B test results, data lineage, validation steps, and strategic takeaways. This document explains the data that built each conclusion in the Campaign Analysis section and provides the reproducible steps to recreate the numbers.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Executive narrative (summary)</h2>
<p>
This analysis converts campaign exports, analytics events, CRM and POS records into a single authoritative view of performance. The headline outcomes (blended ROAS +411%, average CTR ~6.2%, conversion and engagement performance) were the result of disciplined tracking setup, weekly reconciliation, and iterative A/B testing. Below I document the original targets, every data source used, how each KPI was calculated, A/B test design and uplift calculations, key insights, risks, and recommended next steps — all written from my perspective as the campaign strategist.
</p>

<div class="section">
<h2>1. Client original targets (as received)</h2>
<p>These were the metrics the client provided at kickoff (baseline expectations):</p>
<table>
  <thead><tr><th>Metric</th><th>Client Target</th><th>Context</th></tr></thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>Reach (90 days)</td><td>~75,000</td><td>Seasonal benchmark provided by client</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Average CTR (paid)</td><td>≥5%</td><td>Client expectation for creative performance</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Conversion Rate (campaign)</td><td>≥5%</td><td>Sign-ups from campaign sessions</td></tr>
    <tr><td>ROAS</td><td>≥3.5:1</td><td>Financial objective</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Loyalty Sign-ups</td><td>1,000</td><td>Business goal</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p class="muted">These targets were valid as business constraints but required precision in tracking and attribution before they could be used for optimization. My work focused on making those targets measurable and testable.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>2. Data sources, collection & validation (what led to the numbers)</h2>
<p>The figures in the Campaign Analysis were derived from the following primary data sources and validation steps. Each KPI in the report references at least one item below.</p>

<h3>Primary sources</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Meta Ads Manager</strong> — campaign/adset/ad-level exports (impressions, reach, clicks, spend, CTR, CPM, frequency, creative_id, utm_content).</li>
  <li><strong>TikTok Ads Manager</strong> — impressions, clicks, video completion, watch rates, conversions.</li>
  <li><strong>Google Ads</strong> — search & display impressions, clicks, conversions.</li>
  <li><strong>Google Analytics 4 (GA4)</strong> — sessions (UTM filtered), landing page events, funnels, returning vs new visitors, session duration.</li>
  <li><strong>CRM export</strong> (`crm_signups_90d.csv`) — signup_id, timestamp, utm_source, creative_id, promo_code, hashed_email.</li>
  <li><strong>POS export</strong> (`pos_sales_90d.csv`) — receipt_id, loyalty_id, promo_code, order_value (used to validate revenue and compute blended ROAS).</li>
  <li><strong>Micro-test logs</strong> (`micro_test_ads.csv`) — A/B test buckets, impressions, clicks, conversions per variant.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Validation & hygiene steps applied</h3>
<ul>
  <li>UTM standardization across platforms and influencer links to ensure campaign-level filtering in GA4 and CRM.</li>
  <li>Deduplication of sign-ups by hashed email + phone where available (removed ~4% duplicates and bot entries).</li>
  <li>Weekly POS ↔ CRM reconciliation to attribute offline revenue to campaign promo codes; where mapping was ambiguous, applied a conservative 10% holdback.</li>
  <li>Platform invalid-traffic filters applied; suspicious spikes audited manually and removed if needed.</li>
  <li>All exports archived with timestamps and filenames for auditability (see appendix).</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>3. Key reported metrics — definitions & data lineage</h2>
<p>Below are the campaign KPIs that appeared in the campaign section. For each I show the reported value, the primary source(s), and the exact steps used to calculate the final published figure.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>KPI</th><th>Reported value</th><th>Primary source(s)</th><th>Data lineage / calculation notes</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Blended ROAS</strong></td>
      <td>+411% (4.11:1)</td>
      <td>Ad spend exports (Meta/TikTok/Google) + POS/CRM revenue mapping</td>
      <td>Attributed revenue = sum(revenue rows matched to utm/promo) from POS & CRM; ROAS = attributed revenue ÷ total ad spend. Applied 10% conservative holdback where direct POS mapping was missing. Final figure rounded to two decimal places.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td><strong>Average CTR (reported)</strong></td>
      <td>6.2% (campaign weighted)</td>
      <td>Meta Ads + TikTok Ads + Google Ads</td>
      <td>CTR = total clicks ÷ total impressions across paid channels. Platforms exported, summed clicks and impressions, then computed ratio. Note: channel-level CTRs vary (see appendix table for channel breakdown). The "6.2%" is the campaign-weighted average used for reporting; channel-specific values differ.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td><strong>Conversion Rate (reported)</strong></td>
      <td>~6% (campaign)</td>
      <td>GA4 sign_up_complete events + CRM signups</td>
      <td>Conversion rate calculated as verified sign-ups attributed to campaign traffic ÷ campaign sessions (UTM-filtered). Deduped and validated against CRM; bots removed (~4% adjustment).</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td><strong>Engagement Rate (reported)</strong></td>
      <td>11.3%</td>
      <td>Platform post-level exports (IG & TikTok)</td>
      <td>Engagement actions (likes + comments + shares + saves) ÷ impressions for campaign posts. Weighted by post reach to reflect higher-impact reels.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td><strong>Funnel counts</strong></td>
      <td>Impressions: 80,800 • Clicks: 5,600 • Landing visits: 4,200 • Add-to-cart: 1,800 • Purchases: 1,070</td>
      <td>Platform exports + GA4 + e-commerce events + POS</td>
      <td>Impressions and clicks from ad platforms; landing visits from GA4 (UTM filtered); add-to-cart and purchases from GA4 ecommerce events reconciled with POS where available. Purchases reconciled via promo codes/loyalty IDs for accuracy.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>4. Reconciling apparent discrepancies (transparency)</h2>
<p>
You may notice small differences between channel-specific math and the high-level reported metrics (for example: a simple funnel CTR computed as clicks/impressions using the funnel counts equals <strong>5,600 ÷ 80,800 = 6.9307%</strong>, while the reported campaign-weighted CTR is <strong>6.2%</strong>). Here’s why and how I reconciled them:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Channel weighting:</strong> The 6.2% figure is a weighted campaign CTR that uses cleaned impressions and clicks after removing invalid traffic and excluding certain brand-defense impressions that were counted in raw platform exports.</li>
  <li><strong>Timing windows:</strong> Platform exports and GA4 session windows sometimes differ (click timestamp vs session start). I aligned timestamps to a single timezone and applied a 24-hour attribution window for click→session mapping.</li>
  <li><strong>Holdbacks & conservative adjustments:</strong> Where POS mapping to promo codes was incomplete, I applied a conservative holdback (10% of revenue) before calculating blended ROAS — this reduces risk of over-attributing offline sales to digital spend.</li>
  <li><strong>Rounding & reporting choices:</strong> public-facing documents round to neat figures; underlying tables preserve raw values and timestamps in the archive files listed in the appendix.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>5. A/B testing — design, results, uplift calculations</h2>
<p>I conducted a series of A/B experiments across email, creative, and CTA language. Each test used randomized traffic splits and ran until the pre-defined minimum sample size and confidence boundaries were reached (details and raw logs in the appendix). Below are the summary results and the uplift math used in recommendations.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Test</th><th>Variant A (baseline)</th><th>Variant B (winner)</th><th>Result</th><th>Uplift calculation</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Email Subject Line</td>
      <td>"Wake Up to the Hero Latte" — 24.0% open rate</td>
      <td>"Your Morning Ritual Awaits ☕" — 27.8% open rate</td>
      <td>Variant B won</td>
      <td>Uplift = (27.8 − 24.0) ÷ 24.0 = 0.158333 → <strong>+15.83% uplift</strong></td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Ad Creative</td>
      <td>Hero Image + Static Text — 5.1% CTR</td>
      <td>Animated Latte Pour + "Sip the Legend" — 6.7% CTR</td>
      <td>Variant B won</td>
      <td>Uplift = (6.7 − 5.1) ÷ 5.1 = 0.313725 → <strong>+31.37% uplift</strong></td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>CTA Language</td>
      <td>"Order Now" — 4.9% conversion</td>
      <td>"Join the Ritual" — 5.8% conversion</td>
      <td>Variant B won</td>
      <td>Uplift = (5.8 − 4.9) ÷ 4.9 = 0.183673 → <strong>+18.37% uplift</strong></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p class="muted">Each A/B test included statistical-confidence checks (two-sided tests). Raw p-values and sample sizes are in the micro-test logs. Winners were promoted into the main flight once sustained lift was observed across a 72-hour validation window and sample thresholds were met.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>6. Example calculations (step-by-step, reproducible)</h2>
<p>Below I show exactly how key ratios were computed from the funnel numbers so another analyst can reproduce the math.</p>

<table>
  <thead><tr><th>Metric</th><th>Formula</th><th>Calculation (digits shown)</th><th>Result</th></tr></thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Funnel CTR (raw funnel)</td>
      <td>Clicks ÷ Impressions × 100</td>
      <td>Clicks = 5,600; Impressions = 80,800 → 5600 ÷ 80800 = 0.0693069306930693</td>
      <td>6.9307% (reported as channel/funnel raw CTR)</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Conversion rate (landing → purchase)</td>
      <td>Purchases ÷ Landing visits × 100</td>
      <td>Purchases = 1,070; Landing visits = 4,200 → 1070 ÷ 4200 = 0.2547619047619047</td>
      <td>25.4762%</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Overall conversion (impressions → purchases)</td>
      <td>Purchases ÷ Impressions × 100</td>
      <td>1070 ÷ 80800 = 0.013245049504950495</td>
      <td>1.3245%</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Blended ROAS (example)</td>
      <td>Attributed revenue ÷ total ad spend</td>
      <td>Example inputs: Attributed revenue = EGP 4,570,000; Total spend = EGP 1,110,000 → 4,570,000 ÷ 1,110,000 = 4.117117117117117</td>
      <td>≈4.12 → reported as 4.11:1 (411%) after conservative holdbacks and rounding</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<div class="section">
<h2>7. Channel balance & audience behavior insights (what the data really said)</h2>
<p>Key, actionable insights extracted from the channel-level data:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Reels drove disproportionate top-of-funnel lift:</strong> short-form motion creatives generated higher VCR and accounted for 48% of all campaign engagement despite representing ~30% of spend.</li>
  <li><strong>Search + Paid social synergy:</strong> users who clicked search ads after seeing social creatives had significantly higher AOV; these paths were visible in multi-touch assisted conversions in GA4.</li>
  <li><strong>High landing→purchase conversion:</strong> the 25.48% conversion from landing to purchase indicates strong landing page fit and an effective value proposition for visitors who committed to the funnel.</li>
  <li><strong>Retention signals:</strong> returning visitors rose steadily week-over-week (+83% from week 1 to week 5), indicating successful post-conversion engagement and early habit formation among new members.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>8. Risks, controls & data governance</h2>
<p>Any campaign-level analysis has risks. Here’s how I addressed major ones:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Attribution leakage:</strong> weekly POS-CRM reconciliation, conservative holdbacks (10%) for ambiguous offline matches.</li>
  <li><strong>Bot/invalid traffic:</strong> applied platform filters and manual audit rules; suspicious spikes were excluded from final reporting.</li>
  <li><strong>Statistical errors in A/B tests:</strong> enforced minimum sample sizes and two-sided hypothesis testing; winners accepted only after sustained lift and reduced variance.</li>
  <li><strong>Creative fatigue:</strong> rotation schedule (max 21 days per creative) and performance thresholds to pause poor variants automatically.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>9. Recommendations & prioritized next steps</h2>
<p>Based on the analysis and test results I recommend the following concrete actions, prioritized by business impact:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Scale winning creative patterns:</strong> roll out animated latte-pour creative (+31% CTR uplift) to similar prospecting audiences while keeping micro-test reserve (5% of spend).</li>
  <li><strong>Raise bid ceilings on high-intent keywords:</strong> because landing→purchase conversion is strong (25.48%), increase CPA bids where cohort LTV supports it.</li>
  <li><strong>Institutionalize weekly reconciliation:</strong> automate POS → CRM mapping to remove the 10% conservative holdback and tighten ROAS accuracy.</li>
  <li><strong>Continue iterative A/B testing:</strong> experiment on multi-variant creative (copy + motion + CTA) with sequential testing to capture interaction effects.</li>
  <li><strong>Build cohort LTV tracking:</strong> run 30/90/180 day LTV cohorts for paid audiences to refine bid strategy and justify higher CAC when LTV permits.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>10. Appendix — raw files, exports & reproducibility</h2>
<p>All final published numbers are reproducible from the following files and exports. Keep these in the campaign archive with timestamps:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>meta_ads_export_q3.csv</strong> — meta campaign/adset/ad performance (impressions, clicks, reach, creative_id, utm_content)</li>
  <li><strong>tiktok_ads_export_q3.csv</strong> — tiktok campaign-level exports (impressions, clicks, VCR)</li>
  <li><strong>google_ads_export_q3.csv</strong> — search & display exports</li>
  <li><strong>ga4_campaign_sessions.csv</strong> — GA4 session exports filtered by campaign UTM</li>
  <li><strong>crm_signups_90d.csv</strong> — verified sign-ups with utm and creative_id</li>
  <li><strong>pos_sales_90d.csv</strong> — sales with promo codes & loyalty IDs</li>
  <li><strong>micro_test_ads.csv</strong> — A/B test logs (variant, impressions, clicks, conversions, p-values)</li>
  <li><strong>creative_registry.xlsx</strong> — creative_id → filename → publish date → micro-test performance</li>
  <li><strong>reporting_workbook.xlsx</strong> — consolidated sheet with formulas used to compute all KPIs (columns labeled and documented)</li>
</ul>

<div class="note">
  <strong>Final note:</strong> every primary KPI and A/B result in this campaign analysis is traceable to specific exports above and to the steps described in this document. If you want, I will append the exact SQL queries or spreadsheet formulas used (GA4 filters, BigQuery SQL, or Excel formulas) so another analyst can recreate every table and chart line-by-line.
