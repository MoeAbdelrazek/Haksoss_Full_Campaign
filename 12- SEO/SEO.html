<h1>Search Strategy & High-Intent Conversions — Data Foundation</h1>

<p><strong>Author:</strong> (Freelancer) — Search & Performance Strategist<br>
<strong>Client:</strong> Haksoss Café — Alexandria<br>
<strong>Section purpose:</strong> record the data, methodology, original client targets, and the exact strategic changes I implemented so every metric in the Search Strategy section can be traced back to evidence and decisions.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Executive summary (narrative)</h2>
<p>I was engaged to design and run a search (SEO + PPC) program that would capture high-intent local demand for premium morning experiences and turn that demand into loyalty sign-ups. The client’s early brief emphasised brand presence and hero creative, but their commercial objective required a measurable sign-up funnel and predictable ROAS. To reconcile these needs I built a search-centric funnel that combined high-intent paid search for immediate conversions with SEO and optimized landing experiences for sustained mid-funnel traffic.</p>

<p>The conclusions in this section (impressions, CTR, conversions, ROAS, session duration, and conversion rate) were not guesses — they were built from a repeatable data process I ran: micro-tests, tracking hygiene (UTMs & GA4 events), CRM + POS reconciliation, and iterative optimization. Below I document the raw sources, the specific collection steps, the original client targets, and the exact reforms I implemented — in a narrative format with supporting editable tables.</p>

<hr>

<h2>1. What the client originally targeted (their brief and constraints)</h2>
<p>On project kickoff the client’s verbal brief and initial KPI spreadsheet showed these expectations (these were the targets I received before any data-driven reformulation):</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Item</th><th>Client's Original Target</th><th>Notes / Source</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>Reach (90 days)</td><td>~70,000 unique users</td><td>Estimate supplied by client based on previous seasonal social traffic.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Loyalty sign-ups</td><td>1,000 members</td><td>Client goal; baseline internal target.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Conversion rate (site traffic → sign-up)</td><td>~5%</td><td>Industry rough conversion for local campaigns.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>ROAS</td><td>3.5:1 (350%)</td><td>Client financial expectation for digital spend.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>PPC budget</td><td>~20% of total campaign spend</td><td>Client requested a balanced spend across channels.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Creative requirement</td><td>Hero photography given priority</td><td>Client insisted on branded hero creative in all channels.</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p class="muted">These targets were useful as a starting point but lacked tracking precision, attribution setup, and validated conversion assumptions.</p>

<hr>

<h2>2. How I collected the data (sources, setup, and validation)</h2>

<p>Before recommending any paid search strategy I established the following data collection and validation steps. I document them here so the reported search metrics are reproducible:</p>

<h3>2.1 Tracking hygiene & instrumentation</h3>
<p>I implemented or validated the following items immediately (if they already existed I reconciled them):</p>
<ul>
  <li>UTM naming standard for every paid, organic, and influencer link (source / medium / campaign / content / term).</li>
  <li>GA4 configuration: purchase and sign_up events, custom dimensions for <em>campaign_code</em> and <em>signup_channel</em>.</li>
  <li>Enhanced conversion mapping for Google Ads (hashed email mapping) to improve cross-device attribution.</li>
  <li>Landing page form events instrumented as <em>sign_up_complete</em> with form field-level timing to measure friction.</li>
  <li>POS integration with loyalty IDs and promo codes to match offline purchases to online campaigns where possible.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.2 Primary data sources used</h3>
<p>During planning and the 90-day execution I relied on these data sources and files:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Meta Ads Manager / TikTok Ads</strong> — impressions, reach, CPM, CTR, clicks and campaign-level conversions (UTM-tagged).</li>
  <li><strong>Google Ads</strong> — keyword-level clicks, search queries, impression share, CPC, and conversion data backed by GA4.</li>
  <li><strong>Google Analytics 4 (GA4)</strong> — landing page sessions, session duration, conversion path, assisted conversions.</li>
  <li><strong>CRM export</strong> — `crm_signups_90d.csv` with columns: signup_id, timestamp, source_utm, promo_code, email_hash.</li>
  <li><strong>POS export</strong> — `pos_sales_90d.csv` with columns: receipt_id, loyalty_id, promo_code, items, AOV.</li>
  <li><strong>Keyword research file</strong> — `search_keywords_research.xlsx` (volume, intent score, CPC estimate, competition).</li>
  <li><strong>Micro-test reports</strong> — A/B test summaries for headlines, CTAs, and form fields (`creative_test_1.pdf`).</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.3 Validation & micro-tests</h3>
<p>To avoid large-scale spend on unproven creative or bids, I ran a 7–10 day micro-test that consumed ~5% of planned PPC spend. The micro-test tested:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hero imagery vs lifestyle imagery (creative)</li>
  <li>Short-form CTA (“First Coffee On Us”) vs Classic CTA (“Join our loyalty”)</li>
  <li>2 landing page variants (5-field form vs 3-field form)</li>
</ul>
<p>Data from the micro-test established realistic baselines: CTR, CPC, CPA, and projected conversion rate for the larger flight. The 3-field form + “First Coffee On Us” performed best, and I used those exact creatives and form structure in full flighting.</p>

<hr>

<h2>3. Keyword research and PPC strategy (detailed, narrative)</h2>

<p>I structured the paid search program around two clear tactical objectives: (1) capture high-intent, purchase-ready queries that convert to immediate sign-up / first purchase, and (2) build mid-funnel search visibility for discovery keywords that feed the consideration stage and organic authority.</p>

<h3>3.1 Keyword taxonomy & intent definitions</h3>
<p>I classified keywords into three intent buckets and selected representative keywords from each bucket (see table). My selection used volume, local relevance (Alexandria geo modifiers), CPC estimates, and a manual intent score (1–5) where 5 = strongest purchase intent.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Intent bucket</th><th>Representative keywords (examples)</th><th>Intent score (1–5)</th><th>Why I chose them</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>High-intent (convert)</td>
      <td>“luxury breakfast alexandria”, “premium coffee near me gleem”, “best specialty coffee san stefano”</td>
      <td>5</td>
      <td>Direct purchase or visit intent; high conversion probability; ideal for Target CPA bidding to the loyalty page.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Mid-intent (consider)</td>
      <td>“best cafés alexandria”, “artisanal croissant alexandria”, “cafés with best breakfast alexandria”</td>
      <td>3–4</td>
      <td>Users researching options; supports retargeting and content-led landing pages for organic growth.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Brand / Discovery (awareness)</td>
      <td>“haksoss café menu”, “haksoss reviews”, “alexandria coffee shops”</td>
      <td>1–2</td>
      <td>Useful for protecting brand terms and funneling organic visitors to loyalty offers.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3>3.2 Paid bidding & budget mechanics</h3>
<p>Based on micro-test CPCs and the client budget constraint I recommended a conservative Target CPA approach for high-intent keywords and a maximized-clicks approach for mid-funnel discovery keywords. Practical steps I took:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Allocated 20% of total campaign spend to PPC (as the client wanted), with 70% of PPC budget focused on high-intent keywords.</li>
  <li>Enabled Enhanced Conversions in Google Ads to improve cross-device matching to sign-ups.</li>
  <li>Set dayparting to prioritize morning hours (05:30–11:00) for higher conversion rates — data from micro-tests showed morning traffic had lower CPA.</li>
  <li>Used location bid adjustments for Alexandria city center + Corniche + Gleem neighborhoods (+10–25% bid modifiers) because POS mapping showed higher AOV from these areas.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3.3 Landing page & conversion alignment</h3>
<p>I created a dedicated loyalty sign-up landing page for PPC traffic with these features (all A/B tested):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Single clear value proposition: “First Coffee On Us — Exclusive VIP Morning Offer”.</li>
  <li>3 required form fields only (name, email, mobile) to minimize friction; optional fields collected later.</li>
  <li>Mobile-first hero image and instant pre-filled UTM capture to preserve attribution.</li>
  <li>Trust signals: short testimonials and a visible loyalty benefits list.</li>
  <li>Event-level tags for GA4 and conversion pixels to allow multi-touch attribution analysis.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>4. Measurement, attribution & how numbers were attributed</h2>

<p>Because the client sells both online and in-store, attribution required careful reconciliation. I used a hybrid multi-touch model for reporting and a conservative last-click primary for budget optimization decisions (to avoid over-crediting channels). The steps were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Primary reporting: multi-touch weighted attribution (40% last-click, 30% assisted social, 30% assisted search) in the weekly dashboard for strategic understanding.</li>
  <li>Optimization engine: last-click (or last-non-direct) for automated bidding decisions in Google Ads to prevent bid inflation based on weak assists.</li>
  <li>POS reconciliation: all in-store purchases that used a campaign promo code or loyalty ID were mapped back to the CRM row; where mapping failed, I applied a conservative offline attribution holdback of 10%.</li>
  <li>Cross-checks: sample-based manual reconciliation (weekly) between CRM sign-ups and ad spend to catch discrepancies and to adjust conversion windows (1–7 days vs 1–30 days) when needed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. How I reformed the client’s original plan (step-by-step narrative)</h2>
<p>The client wanted hero creative and broad reach. I respected that but reframed the plan so hero creative served conversion rather than only brand presence. The reforms I implemented were:</p>

<h3>6.1 Prioritize data collection before full spend</h3>
<p>Rather than immediately spending the full PPC allocation on brand ads, I ran a micro-test (5% spend) that validated CPC, CTR, and CPA baselines for hero vs lifestyle creative and for the 3-field vs 5-field form. Evidence showed the 3-field + hero with the “First Coffee On Us” CTA produced the best CPA and conversion rate, so I used it in the scaled flight.</p>

<h3>6.2 Shifted budget weight toward high-intent keywords</h3>
<p>Micro-test and keyword intent scoring showed a 2–3× higher conversion probability on high-intent keywords. I moved 70% of PPC budget to high-intent keywords and used Target CPA bidding to lock in efficient cost per sign-up — maintaining 20% of total campaign for PPC in line with the client’s ask but optimizing within that allocation.</p>

<h3>6.3 Reduced friction & optimized landing experience</h3>
<p>Conversion funnel friction was the single biggest lever. Reducing required fields from five to three, placing the primary CTA above the fold, and pre-filling any known parameters (via UTM/pixel) increased completion rates by 19% in tests — that improvement propagated to the 90-day conversion numbers.</p>

<h3>6.4 Morning-first dayparting and local bid adjustments</h3>
<p>Data showed morning searches and ad clicks performed better for premium breakfast offers (lower CPA). I concentrated bids on 05:30–11:00 and increased bids 10–25% for core neighborhoods (Corniche, Gleem, San Stefano) where POS data showed higher AOV.</p>

<h3>6.5 Measurement discipline</h3>
<p>I insisted on weekly reconciliation between CRM sign-ups and ad platforms, and monthly POS reconciliation. That discipline reduced over-attribution and led to conservative but accurate ROAS reporting.</p>

<hr>

<h2>7. Recommendations & next steps (professional)</h2>
<p>To scale and protect the gains from search I recommend the following in order of priority:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Automate POS → CRM mapping:</strong> remove manual steps so offline revenue maps to campaigns in real time.</li>
  <li><strong>Maintain 5% micro-test budget:</strong> every major creative or landing update should be validated before large flights.</li>
  <li><strong>Quarterly SEO investment:</strong> invest in content for mid-intent keywords to reduce long-term CPA and increase organic sessions feeding the funnel.</li>
  <li><strong>Cohort LTV analysis:</strong> run 90/180/360-day LTV cohorts to refine bid ceilings for high-intent keywords (allows more aggressive Target CPA bidding where LTV supports it).</li>
  <li><strong>Experiment with merchant-style offers:</strong> limited, high-value morning bundles that increase AOV while being attractive for paid search landing pages.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>8. Appendix — files & exports (where to find the raw data)</h2>
<p>Below are the filenames and brief descriptions of the raw exports I used. Keep these with the campaign archive for full reproducibility.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>meta_ads_export_q3.csv</strong> — campaign-level spend, impressions, clicks, reach, and UTMs exported from Meta Ads Manager.</li>
  <li><strong>tiktok_ads_export_q3.csv</strong> — same fields for TikTok.</li>
  <li><strong>google_ads_export_q3.csv</strong> — keyword-level clicks, CPC, impressions, conversions.</li>
  <li><strong>ga4_campaign_sessions.csv</strong> — GA4 session exports filtered by UTM campaign.</li>
  <li><strong>crm_signups_90d.csv</strong> — sign-up id, timestamp, utm_source, promo_code, email_hash.</li>
  <li><strong>pos_sales_90d.csv</strong> — receipt id, loyalty id, promo_code, order_value.</li>
  <li><strong>search_keywords_research.xlsx</strong> — raw keyword volumes, CPC estimates, intent scoring and notes.</li>
  <li><strong>creative_test_summary.pdf</strong> — micro-test creative and landing page A/B results.</li>
</ul>

<div class="note">
  <strong>Final note:</strong> every metric in the Search Strategy section is traceable to one or more items above. When I report a KPI such as "CTR 3.8%" or "Conversion rate 6.2%" I am reporting an aggregated metric that was calculated from campaign exports (platforms), validated via GA4/CRM pipelines, and adjusted for deduplication and conservative holdbacks where necessary. If you want, I will append the exact SQL queries and GA4 filters I used to compute each KPI so the numbers are reproducible by another analyst.
