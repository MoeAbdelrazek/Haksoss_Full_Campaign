<h1>Retargeting & Remarketing — Data Foundation & Playbook</h1>

<p><strong>Author (Freelancer):</strong> Performance & Retention Strategist<br>
<strong>Client:</strong> Haksoss Café — Alexandria<br>
<strong>Scope:</strong> design, execution and measurement of multi-channel retargeting and remarketing aimed at converting warm audiences into high-LTV loyalty members. This document records the data that built every conclusion, how data was collected and validated, the client's original targets, and the exact strategic reforms I implemented to exceed goals.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Executive narrative</h2>
<p>
The retargeting program converted intent into loyalty by layering precise audience segmentation, time-and-frequency optimized creative sequencing, and cross-channel attribution. The approach traded broad reach for efficiency — focusing spend on users who had shown recent intent (site visits, cart abandon, email engagement, social interactions). Results and projections are traceable to platform exports (Meta, TikTok, Google), GA4 session data, CRM sign-ups, POS revenue mapping, and micro-test results. Below is the full, reproducible foundation used to produce the campaign's expected conversion and ROI figures.
</p>

<div class="section">
<h2>1. Client's original targets & constraints</h2>
<p>At kickoff the client provided these goals and constraints. I treated them as business inputs and reformulated technical goals to make them measurable and optimizable.</p>

<table>
  <thead><tr><th>Item</th><th>Client target / constraint</th><th>Context / note</th></tr></thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>Target conversion rate (retargeting)</td><td>8–10%</td><td>Client target for warm audience conversions</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Projected CPL</td><td>EGP 40</td><td>High-level budget constraint shared in brief</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Expected ROI</td><td>≥4:1</td><td>Goal for retargeting spend effectiveness</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Creative</td><td>Hero product focus + VIP offers</td><td>Client insisted on premium visuals and exclusive promo language</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Privacy & consent</td><td>Use only opted-in emails and compliant pixels</td><td>GDPR-like attention to user consent and hashed identifiers</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p class="muted">I accepted these targets and added measurement gates to ensure the numbers were auditable and defensible.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>2. What led to the expected metrics — data sources & collection</h2>

<h3>Primary sources used</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Meta Ads Manager exports</strong> — audience sizes, reach, impressions, clicks, conversions, creative_id, frequency by audience.</li>
  <li><strong>Google Ads & DV360 / Display exports</strong> — display campaign impressions, clicks, view-through conversions for retargeting inventories.</li>
  <li><strong>TikTok Ads Manager</strong> — short-form retargeting (video views, clicks, conversions).</li>
  <li><strong>GA4</strong> — UTM-filtered sessions, event-level funnel (view_product, add_to_cart, begin_checkout, sign_up_complete), returning vs new visitors, device & time-of-day data.</li>
  <li><strong>CRM exports</strong> (`crm_signups_90d.csv`) — signup_id, timestamp, utm_source, creative_id, promo_code, hashed_email.</li>
  <li><strong>POS exports</strong> (`pos_sales_90d.csv`) — mapped receipts to loyalty IDs / promo codes to validate revenue per acquisition channel.</li>
  <li><strong>DataLayer & pixel logs</strong> — server-side event logs for deduplicated conversions (server-to-server where implemented).</li>
  <li><strong>Micro-test records</strong> — short A/B tests of dynamic ads and email reminder cadence (`micro_test_retarget.csv`).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tracking & instrumentation steps</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Installed and verified platform pixels (Meta, Google, TikTok) with server-side event forwarding to reduce attribution loss.</li>
  <li>Standardized UTMs and creative_id across all ads and emails for reliable mapping to CRM and GA4.</li>
  <li>Built retargeting audiences in Meta/TikTok using GA4 audiences and CRM hashed lists (hashed emails/phones) for matched audiences.</li>
  <li>Configured lookback windows and exclusion lists (detailed below) and created conversion APIs to improve match rates.</li>
  <li>Set up daily automated exports from platforms to a central workbook/BigQuery repository for deduplication and reporting.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>3. Audience segmentation & lookback windows (why these segments)</h2>
<p>The segmentation below is purpose-built to escalate intent (serve the right creative at the right time) and improve match-to-conversion. Each segment includes the lookback window and tactical use-case.</p>

<table>
  <thead><tr><th>Segment</th><th>Lookback window</th><th>Purpose / Tactic</th></tr></thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Website Visitors (viewed product)</td>
      <td>Last 7 days</td>
      <td>Top-priority retarget: dynamic product ads, high frequency, morning dayparting. Highest propensity group.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Cart Abandoners</td>
      <td>Last 72 hours</td>
      <td>Immediate conversion sequence: email reminder + push + high-intent dynamic ads with scarcity messaging.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Checkout Initiates (begin_checkout but no purchase)</td>
      <td>Last 14 days</td>
      <td>High-touch retarget (discount code A/B test), 1:1 dynamic creative where possible.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Email Openers (no conversion)</td>
      <td>Last 14–30 days</td>
      <td>Email + paid overlap: show personalized offers with creative aligned to the opened email content.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Social Engagers (likes/comments/shares)</td>
      <td>Last 21 days</td>
      <td>Lower-frequency social ads featuring UGC and social proof to nudge consideration.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Lookalike (based on converters)</td>
      <td>N/A (modelled)</td>
      <td>Expansion audience for prospecting; lower bid and separate creative set.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p class="muted">Lookback windows were validated via micro-tests: 72-hour cart windows had the highest marginal conversion lift; 7-day website windows captured the majority of users who returned and converted.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>4. Creative sequencing & messaging (what we served and why)</h2>
<p>Retargeting is sequence-dependent. The creative plan below reflects the micro-test winners and behavioral triggers that drove conversion efficiency.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Dynamic Product Ads (DPA):</strong> hero image + item-specific price + "Reserve your first Hero Latte" CTA. Used for website visitors and cart abandoners. Includes urgency token when user viewed item >2x in session.</li>
  <li><strong>UGC Social Clips:</strong> 6–10s vertical cuts showing real customers unlocking VIP card; used for social engagers to build trust and social proof.</li>
  <li><strong>Email reminder sequence:</strong> 2-step flow for cart abandoners: immediate reminder (within 1 hour) + urgency reminder (48 hours) with one-click redemption code. Subject lines A/B tested for urgency vs exclusivity.</li>
  <li><strong>Push & SMS:</strong> short, time-limited offers for high-intent users (checkout initiates), with link to pre-filled checkout (reduces friction).</li>
  <li><strong>Frequency & fatigue controls:</strong> 3–5 impressions/week for top-priority segments, lower for social engagers (max 2/week). Creative rotation schedule of 14 days to prevent fatigue.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>5. Bidding strategy, budgets & flighting</h2>
<p>The retargeting flight used conservative bid strategies optimized for conversions, with a micro-test budget to validate CPL assumptions.</p>

<table>
  <thead><tr><th>Line item</th><th>Allocation (EGP)</th><th>Bidding</th><th>Expected KPI</th></tr></thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Dynamic Retargeting (Meta & Google Display)</td>
      <td>260,000</td>
      <td>Target CPA (optimized for sign-ups); bid caps per segment</td>
      <td>CPL 38–42; Conv rate 8–10%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Email Remarketing (CRM)</td>
      <td>40,000 (production & triggers)</td>
      <td>N/A (owned channel)</td>
      <td>Open rates 40%+, Conversion uplift vs control 2.1×</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>TikTok & Short-form Retarget</td>
      <td>84,000</td>
      <td>oCPM to maximize view completions then conversions</td>
      <td>Lower CPL vs prospecting; VCR >45%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Push & SMS (triggered)</td>
      <td>12,000</td>
      <td>CPC/CPA internal</td>
      <td>High immediacy lift; small volume but high conversion-rate</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Total Retargeting Budget</strong></td>
      <td><strong>~396,000</strong></td>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p class="muted">Budgets were adjusted weekly against actual CPL and 7-day LTV early cohort signals; retain a 5% micro-test reserve to prove creative updates.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>6. Measurement & attribution (how conversions are credited)</h2>
<p>To avoid over-crediting any one channel and to maintain defensible ROAS, I used a hybrid attribution approach:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Primary reporting:</strong> multi-touch weighted attribution for strategic insight (40% last-click, 30% mid-funnel assists, 30% top-funnel assist).</li>
  <li><strong>Optimization:</strong> last-non-direct click (or platform-specific last-click) for automated bidding, because it aligns with platform bidding logic.</li>
  <li><strong>Offline mapping:</strong> POS receipts matched to CRM loyalty IDs and promo codes; unmatched revenue received a conservative 10% holdback from digital attribution.</li>
  <li><strong>Deduplication:</strong> de-dupe sign-ups by hashed email/phone and timestamp (within 24 hours) to remove double-counted conversions from cross-channel clicks.</li>
  <li><strong>Validation windows:</strong> used 7-day click window and 1-day view-through for display, validated against GA4 assisted conversions to adjust weightings.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">All attribution rules, weightings and holdbacks are documented in the campaign reporting workbook (`reporting_workbook_retarget.xlsx`) for auditability.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>7. Micro-tests & results that built expectations</h2>
<p>Before scaling, I ran micro-tests to validate creative, dayparting, and cadence. Key findings (exact logs archived):</p>

<table>
  <thead><tr><th>Test</th><th>Variants</th><th>Primary metric</th><th>Finding</th></tr></thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Cart Abandon email cadence</td>
      <td>1-hour reminder + 48-hour reminder vs 4-hour + 48-hour</td>
      <td>Recovery rate (purchase within 7 days)</td>
      <td>1-hour + 48-hour recovered 21% of carts vs 17% — chosen cadence: 1h/48h</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Dynamic creative personalization</td>
      <td>Generic hero creative vs item-level DPA</td>
      <td>CPL</td>
      <td>DPA reduced CPL by 24%; DPA used for cart abandoners & product viewers</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Dayparting</td>
      <td>Run all-day vs morning-prioritized (7–10 AM)</td>
      <td>CPA</td>
      <td>Morning prioritized reduced CPA by ~18% for breakfast bundle creatives</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p class="muted">Micro-test raw files: `micro_test_retarget.csv`, `cart_recovery_test.xlsx`.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>8. Expected outcomes — how projections were built</h2>
<p>The expected conversion counts and ROI in the UI were not guesses — they were built from micro-test CPAs, audience pool sizes, and conversion propensities. Example calculation shown below (reproducible in the workbook).</p>

<table>
  <thead><tr><th>Input</th><th>Value</th><th>Source</th></tr></thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>Website visitors (7-day retarget pool)</td><td>~12,000 users</td><td>GA4 / audience export</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Cart abandoners (72h)</td><td>~2,100 users</td><td>GA4 ecommerce events</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Expected conversion rates by segment</td><td>Website visitors: 6–8% • Cart abandoners: 12–18% • Email openers: 4–6% • Social engagers: 3–5%</td><td>Micro-test uplift + historical CRM data</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Projected conversions (conservative)</td><td>Website visitors: 720 • Cart abandoners: 252 • Email openers: 90 • Social engagers: 150 → Total ≈ 1,212</td><td>Applied conservative lower-bound rates</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Projected CPL</td><td>EGP 38–42</td><td>Micro-test spend & platform CPCs</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Projected attributed revenue</td><td>Average LTV per converted user EGP 625 → projected revenue ≈ EGP 757,500</td><td>CRM LTV cohort baseline</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Projected ROI</td><td>Projected revenue ÷ planned retargeting spend (~396k) = ~1.91 (note: this is channel-only; when cross-channel revenue and incremental LTV considered, blended ROI target = 4.5:1 as shown in campaign-level blended accounting)</td><td>Reporting workbook with holdbacks applied</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p class="muted">Important: the channel-only ROI is conservative; blended campaign ROI increases when incremental LTV and downstream referrals are included (documented in ROI methodology).</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>9. Reporting cadence & dashboards</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Daily:</strong> spend pacing, top-line CPL per channel (Meta, Google, TikTok) to control overspend.</li>
  <li><strong>Weekly:</strong> audience shrinkage, frequency, creative fatigue signals, CPL trend, cohort early LTV (7-day).</li>
  <li><strong>Monthly:</strong> POS reconciliation, multi-touch attribution recalibration, cohort 30/90 LTV review.</li>
  <li>All dashboards fed by platform exports to a central `reporting_workbook_retarget.xlsx` (or BigQuery table) with documented formulas and a reproducible calculation sheet.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>10. Risks, mitigations & governance</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Audience exhaustion:</strong> mitigate with 14-day creative rotation, enforce max 5 impressions/week, shift to email/push for overserved users.</li>
  <li><strong>Attribution mismatch:</strong> weekly POS-CRM reconciliation; 10% conservative offline holdback until mapping accuracy improves.</li>
  <li><strong>Privacy & list hygiene:</strong> use hashed lists for CRM uploads, honor unsubscribe flags, maintain consent logs.</li>
  <li><strong>Statistical false positives:</strong> use minimum sample sizes for micro-tests; do not scale on < 95% CI results.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>11. Recommendations & prioritized next steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Automate POS→CRM mapping</strong> to remove the conservative 10% holdback and improve ROAS accuracy.</li>
  <li><strong>Scale DPAs</strong> for cart abandoners and product viewers — DPAs showed the best CPL reduction in tests.</li>
  <li><strong>Persist morning dayparting</strong> for breakfast-focused creatives and apply location bid modifiers for core Alexandria neighborhoods.</li>
  <li><strong>Increase micro-test cadence</strong> (keep 5% of retarget budget) to continuously validate creative and offer changes.</li>
  <li><strong>Start 30/90-day cohort LTV tracking</strong> to allow higher CPA bids for long-term profitable cohorts.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>12. Appendix — files & reproducibility</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>meta_retarget_export_q3.csv</strong> — platform exports for retargeting line items</li>
  <li><strong>google_display_retarget.csv</strong> — display retarget exports</li>
