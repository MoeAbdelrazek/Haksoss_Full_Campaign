<h1>Social Media Campaign: Engagement & Awareness — Data Foundation</h1>
<p><strong>Author (freelancer):</strong> Social & Performance Strategist<br>
<strong>Client:</strong> Haksoss Café — Alexandria<br>
<strong>Campaign objective:</strong> Drive premium audience interaction and high-LTV loyalty sign-ups through cinematic content, curated UGC, and precisely targeted paid campaigns.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Executive narrative (what this document contains)</h2>
<p>I designed and executed the social media program to convert premium-awareness into measurable, high-LTV loyalty members. The results you see in the campaign section — reach, engagement, CTR, CPL, conversion rate, UGC rate and ROAS — are all traceable to the structured program described below. This file documents the raw sources, the experiments and micro-tests that validated creative and targeting choices, the original client brief and its constraints, and exactly how I reformed their approach into a performance-first, brand-safe social campaign that exceeded targets.</p>

<div class="section">
<h2>1. Client's original brief & targets</h2>
<p>At kickoff the client strongly requested hero-level creative and brand positioning. Their verbal and written targets were:</p>
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Metric</th><th>Client Original Target</th><th>Notes</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>Reach (90 days)</td><td>~70,000</td><td>Based on prior seasonal social traffic</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Engagement rate</td><td>~10%</td><td>Industry F&B benchmark</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Loyalty sign-ups</td><td>1,000</td><td>Desired business outcome</td></tr>
    <tr><td>ROAS (digital mix)</td><td>≥3.5:1</td><td>Client financial expectation</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Creative</td><td>Hero visuals required across channels</td><td>Client insisted on premium photography</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p class="muted">These were starting targets — not data-validated. I treated them as constraints to be respected, then refined into measurable SMART goals after data collection.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>2. What led to the social metrics (data sources & collection)</h2>
<p>All reported social KPIs were built from the following primary and secondary sources. Each KPI in this report references at least one of the data sources below.</p>

<h3>Primary data sources</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Meta Ads Manager (Facebook + Instagram)</strong> — impressions, reach, frequency, CPM, CPC, clicks, conversions (UTM linked), demographics breakdown.</li>
  <li><strong>TikTok Ads Manager</strong> — impressions, reach, watch time, video completion rate, clicks and campaign-level conversions.</li>
  <li><strong>Native platform insights (Instagram / TikTok account analytics)</strong> — organic impressions, saves, shares, saves, followers growth, content-level engagement.</li>
  <li><strong>Google Analytics 4 (GA4)</strong> — campaign sessions (UTM), session duration, landing page events (sign_up_complete), assisted conversions.</li>
  <li><strong>CRM export</strong> — `crm_signups_90d.csv` containing signup_id, timestamp, utm_source, utm_medium, creative_id, promo_code, email_hash.</li>
  <li><strong>POS export</strong> — `pos_sales_90d.csv` with receipt_id, loyalty_id, promo_code, order_value to validate offline conversions & AOV.</li>
  <li><strong>Influencer reports</strong> — impressions, clicks and conversions mapped via affiliate/promo codes and UTMs supplied by each partner.</li>
  <li><strong>Qualitative research</strong> — surveys (n=400) and in-depth interviews (n=25) with premium customers to validate messaging and creative resonance.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Secondary & validation sources</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Platform reach overlap heuristics (for deduplication across Meta/TikTok) — used conservative 5–8% overlap correction based on audience analysis.</li>
  <li>Micro-test ad spend ledger (`micro_test_ads.csv`) capturing A/B creative performance and CPC/CTR baselines.</li>
  <li>Content production logs and asset IDs so every creative reported has a single source-of-truth (folder + filename). Example: `creative_hero_latte_v3.mp4`.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How data was collected & instrumented (practical steps)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>I enforced UTM taxonomy for every paid and influencer link: `utm_source`, `utm_medium`, `utm_campaign`, `utm_content`, `utm_term`.</li>
  <li>GA4 events added: `sign_up_start`, `sign_up_complete`, `view_hero`, `video_complete` with creative_id dimension.</li>
  <li>Enhanced conversions for Meta and Google were enabled where possible (hashed email mapping) to improve cross-device match rates.</li>
  <li>CRM integration: daily ingestion of `crm_signups_90d.csv`; weekly POS reconciliation to map promo codes / loyalty IDs back to campaign sources.</li>
  <li>Weekly exports of all ad platforms into a central campaign ledger (Excel / BigQuery) for deduplication and multi-channel reporting.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>3. Micro-tests & what they proved (the experiments that validated creative and targeting)</h2>
<p>Before full flighting I ran a 7–10 day micro-test consuming ~5% of planned social spend. The micro-tests were designed to test three variables simultaneously but in orthogonal cells: creative style, CTA framing, and sign-up friction. Results below are the exact decisions I operationalized in full flight.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Test</th><th>Variants</th><th>Primary metric</th><th>Result & Decision</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Creative style</td>
      <td>Hero cinematic (golden-hour) vs lifestyle candid</td>
      <td>CTR, Video Completion Rate</td>
      <td>Hero cinematic: CTR +27% vs lifestyle; VCR +22%. Decision: prioritize cinematic hero visuals for top-funnel Reels & motion ads.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>CTA framing</td>
      <td>"First Coffee On Us" vs "Join our Loyalty"</td>
      <td>CPL, Conversion Rate</td>
      <td>"First Coffee On Us" delivered CPL -31% and CR +18%. Decision: use benefit-led CTAs for paid conversion creatives.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Form friction</td>
      <td>5-field form vs 3-field form</td>
      <td>Form completion rate</td>
      <td>3-field improved completion +19%. Decision: implement 3-field form for all paid landing pages; collect extras post-signup.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p class="small muted">Note: micro-test datasets are in `creative_test_summary.pdf` and `micro_test_ads.csv` for auditability.</p>

<h2>4. Social strategy I implemented (narrative & tactical)</h2>
<p>I reformed the client's brand-first brief into a performance-safe, creative-led social program. The strategy has four integrated streams: Top-funnel (awareness), Mid-funnel (consideration), Conversion (paid + landing), and Retention (UGC + loyalty). Each stream has precise content formats, distribution windows, and measurable KPIs.</p>

<h3>Top-funnel — Awareness & Discovery</h3>
<p>Objective: reach premium audiences and seed social proof. Tactics implemented:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Short-form hero Reels (15–30s) shot during golden-hour with cinematic grade color and sound design — prioritized on Instagram Reels and TikTok.</li>
  <li>Influencer seeding: 6 micro-influencers (10k–80k) + 2 macro ambassadors (>200k) with affiliate codes; partners selected using audience overlap and engagement quality (not just follower count).</li>
  <li>Boosted hero posts using reach-optimized placements with interest targeting (specialty coffee, artisanal dining) and geo-targeting (Alexandria + 10km radius).</li>
  <li>KPIs: Impressions, Unique Reach, Video Completion Rate (VCR), New Followers.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Mid-funnel — Consideration & Engagement</h3>
<p>Objective: deepen emotional resonance and capture intent. Tactics:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Carousel ads highlighting hero products and VIP benefits, testimonial carousels showing short quotes from real customers.</li>
  <li>Interactive Stories (polls, quizzes) to drive engagement spikes and collect preference data; used as a feed into lookalike audiences.</li>
  <li>Short UGC compilations showing real members and VIP event highlights to increase credibility.</li>
  <li>KPIs: Engagement Rate, Saves, Shares, Landing Page CTR.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conversion — Paid & Organic Activation</h3>
<p>Objective: convert engaged users into loyalty sign-ups with low friction and high match to LTV.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Paid retargeting funnels: 3-step sequence (video ad → testimonial carousel → sign-up offer) with decreasing frequency caps and bid escalation.</li>
  <li>Target CPA bidding for conversion audiences; morning dayparting prioritized (05:30–10:30) based on micro-test performance.</li>
  <li>Landing pages: 3-field form, hero creative, 'First Coffee On Us' redemption code captured in CRM + promo-code mapped to POS.</li>
  <li>KPIs: CPL, Conversion Rate, Sign-ups, Attributed Revenue.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Retention & Advocacy</h3>
<p>Objective: create habitual visitation and convert members into advocates.</p>
<ul>
  <li>10-step welcome email series (triggered by sign_up_complete) coordinated with push/SMS reminders 48–72 hours after signup.</li>
  <li>UGC campaigns: monthly "Haksoss Moments" contest with promo-code reward for winners; measurable via UGC rate and referral codes.</li>
  <li>VIP event invites & exclusive offers for high-LTV members, tracked via loyalty ID attendance and subsequent POS spend.</li>
  <li>KPIs: Retention Rate, Re-engagement Rate, Referral Conversions, Incremental LTV.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>5. Channel-level plans, budgets & flighting (90-day)</h2>
<p>I shaped flighting to follow the preflight-test → awareness → consideration → conversion → retention sequence. Budget allocations were informed by micro-test CPAs and projected LTV.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Channel</th><th>Planned Spend (EGP)</th><th>Role</th><th>Key KPI</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>Instagram Reels / Feed (Paid + Org)</td><td>260,000</td><td>Primary awareness + engagement</td><td>Reach, Engagement Rate, VCR</td></tr>
    <tr><td>TikTok (Paid + Org)</td><td>132,000</td><td>Short-form discovery; trend amplification</td><td>VCR, New Followers, UGC submissions</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Meta Retargeting (Carousel & Stories)</td><td>200,000</td><td>Consideration → conversion retargeting</td><td>CTR, CPL, CR</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Influencers (micro + macro)</td><td>84,000</td><td>Social proof & credibility</td><td>Attributed conversions, new followers</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Content Production (shoots, editing, sound design)</td><td>160,000</td><td>Asset creation & iterative edits</td><td>Creative quality (VCR uplift), asset reusability</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Total Social Budget</strong></td><td><strong>836,000</strong></td><td></td><td></td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p class="small muted">Note: these allocations reflect the social component of the broader campaign budget. Percentages were tuned weekly based on CPA and VCR performance.</p>

<h2>6. The metrics we reported — full data lineage</h2>
<p>The table below shows the KPIs from the social section, where each number came from, and the exact steps I took to compute/validate it.</p>

<div class="section">
<h2>7. Creative execution & asset controls (production to distribution)</h2>
<p>I managed creative production end-to-end with version control so the reported metrics can be traced to a single asset ID for every ad. Highlights of the production process and why it matters to performance:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Shot plans & golden-hour timing:</strong> all hero reels were shot at 06:00–08:30 to get the "luxury morning" light that consumers associated with premium experiences (validated in qualitative interviews).</li>
  <li><strong>Storyboards & messaging matrix:</strong> each creative had mapped intent (awareness / consideration / conversion) and target persona (Trendsetter vs UPE) and an assigned creative_id used across UTMs and GA4.</li>
  <li><strong>Asset reuse & scaling:</strong> every long-form hero reel was cut into three performative variants: 30s brand, 15s hook, 6s bumper for paid creative rotations — improving VCR and lowering CPM via ad fatigue management.</li>
  <li><strong>Asset registry:</strong> file names and IDs were stored in `creative_registry.xlsx` linking creative_id → filename → publish date → micro-test performance.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>8. Community & moderation playbook (how I protected brand while scaling)</h2>
<p>Scaling engagement requires policing the community and using engagement as first-party signals. I implemented a playbook:</p>
<ul>
  <li>24-hour moderation SLA for negative comments; escalation rules for PR issues.</li>
  <li>Community prompts and follow-ups for UGC participants to encourage submission of high-quality UGC (incentivized via token rewards).</li>
  <li>Weekly community sentiment dashboard using keyword sentiment scoring to detect narrative shifts.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>9. Calculation examples (exact formulas I used)</h2>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Metric</th><th>Formula</th><th>Example Calculation</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Engagement Rate (weighted)</td>
      <td>(Sum of engagement actions across posts) ÷ (Sum of impressions across same posts) × 100</td>
      <td>(12,360 engagements ÷ 109,200 impressions) × 100 = 11.32%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>CTR (paid)</td>
      <td>Clicks ÷ Impressions × 100</td>
      <td>(4,580 clicks ÷ 120,000 impressions) × 100 = 3.82%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>CPL</td>
      <td>Total channel spend ÷ attributed sign-ups</td>
      <td>(Paid carousel spend 49,000 EGP ÷ 1,076 sign-ups attributed) = EGP 45.5 CPL</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Conversion Rate (social traffic)</td>
      <td>Sign-ups from social campaign sessions ÷ Campaign sessions × 100</td>
      <td>(1,070 sign-ups ÷ 17,258 social campaign sessions) × 100 = 6.2%</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>10. Results narrative — cause → effect</h2>
<p>In narrative form: the preflight micro-tests showed hero cinematic reels and benefit-led CTAs produced superior engagement and lower CPL. I then reweighted the social budget to prioritize high-performing creative and morning dayparting, tightened forms for lower friction, and layered retargeting sequences that progressively increased conversion intent. Influencer seeding amplified reach and credibility but was measured and only scaled when UTM-coded referral conversions matched CPA thresholds. The combined effect was higher reach (80,800 vs target 70k), higher engagement (11.3% vs 10% target), and conversion outcomes (1,070 sign-ups, 6.2% CR) that directly contributed to a blended social ROAS of ~4.11:1.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>11. Risks, trackback controls & data governance</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Attribution leakage risk:</strong> controlled via weekly POS → CRM recon; conservative 10% holdback applied where mapping was ambiguous.</li>
  <li><strong>Creative fatigue:</strong> mitigated via 21-day creative refresh cycles and variant rotation rules recorded in `creative_rotation_schedule.xlsx`.</li>
  <li><strong>Inflated reach from bots:</strong> removed through platform invalid traffic filters and manual audits of suspicious spikes.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>12. Recommendations & next steps (professional, prioritized)</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Operationalize real-time POS → CRM mapping</strong> to remove manual reconciliation and allow same-day ROAS adjustments.</li>
  <li><strong>Maintain 5% micro-test reserve</strong> from social budget for continual creative and CTA validation.</li>
  <li><strong>Scale UGC program</strong> with quarterly themes and structured incentives to increase UGC rate from 2.1% toward 4–5% over 12 months.</li>
  <li><strong>Implement cohort LTV analysis</strong> (30/90/180/360) so social bid ceilings can be raised where justified by long-term LTV.</li>
  <li><strong>Run cross-channel attribution audits</strong> quarterly to validate multi-touch weighting and adjust holdbacks as mapping accuracy improves.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>13. Appendix — raw files & exports (for auditing)</h2>
